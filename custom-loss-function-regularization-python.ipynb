    "# Fitting Linear Models with Custom Loss Functions and Regularization in Python\n",

    "As part of a predictive model competition I participated in earlier this month, I found myself trying to accomplish a peculiar task. The challenge organizers were going to use \"mean absolute percentage error\" (MAPE) as their criterion for model evaluation. Since this is not a standard loss function built into most software, I decided to write my own code to train a model that would use the MAPE in its objective function. \n",
    "\n",
    "I started by searching through the SciKit-Learn documentation on [linear models](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.linear_model) to see if the model I needed has already been developed somewhere. I thought that the `sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV` class would accomplish what I wanted (MAPE minimization with L2 regularization), but I could not get the `scoring` argument (which supposedly lets you pass a custom loss function to the model class) to behave as I expected it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I highly recommend searching through existing packages to see if the model you want already exists, you should (in theory) be able to use this notebook as a template for a building linear models with an arbitrary loss function and regularization scheme."

    "> In most applications, your features will be measured on many different scales; however you'll notice in the loss function described above, each $\\beta_k$ parameter is being penalized by the same amount ($\\lambda$). Best practice when using L2 regularization is to **standardize your feature matrix** (subtract the mean off of each column and divide the result by the column standard deviation). This will ensure that all features are on approximately the same scale and that the regularization parameter has an equal impact on all $\\beta_k$ coefficients.\n",
    "\n",

Of course, your regularization parameter $\\lambda$ will not typically fall from the sky.
